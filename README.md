# Adam-Musinski-Portfolio
Project Portfolio

I am building automation test software as a showcase for my professional portfolio.

**Portfoilio Focus:**

Test Architecture: feature-based organization + reusable fixtures + page abstractions
Reliability: stable locator/wait strategy + artifact capture + quarantine policy
Execution Maturity: CI smoke on PR + per-folder regression jobs + fast feedback loops
Quality Mindset: risk-based smoke selection + strategy + triage standards

**Runtime targets**

Smoke suite: ≤ 5 minutes total
Regression: ≤ 10 minutes per test folder
Safety targets
No real domains/URLs
No company/product names
No real auth provider naming
No secrets; only placeholders (env vars + .env.example)
Portfolio targets
Clear README (scan in 60 seconds)
Docs proving QA thinking (TEST_STRATEGY, RELIABILITY, TRIAGE)
CI pipeline showing discipline (smoke PR + regression nightly)
